# Introduction

Power outages are on the rise. With an already collapsing atmosphere, a dramatic increase in natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, the number of power outages is on the rise. According to CITATION, The United States has the most power outages of all developed countries. A nation-wide issue that is estimated to cost around … a year. That is why it is crucial to understand how the characteristics of power outages in the United States have shifted over time. What are the main catalysts of power outages nowadays? How can we best prepare and understand this issue which every citizen experiences for an estimate of 92 minutes a year.

With that in mind, we have decided to investigate the trends in power outage characteristics over time and create a predictive model to predict the cause of major power outages in the hopes that through a deeper understanding we can act accordingly and minimize the number of outages and their impact on communities. The focus of our analysis will be answering the following questions: “How have characteristics of major power outages changed over time?” and  “Is there a clear trend?”. The data we have used comes from the scientific dataset “Data on major power outage events in the continental U.S” and contains the major power outage data in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. 

Using the data from this data set we will employ data analysis techniques to ……
